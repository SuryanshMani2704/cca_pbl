# Cloud Cost Analytics and Deployment Automation  

## Project Overview  
This project demonstrates an end-to-end system for managing cloud cost analytics and automating cloud resource provisioning, configuration, and orchestration. The project uses modern tools such as Terraform, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS services. It integrates Python scripts for data visualization, showcasing AWS cost insights with dynamic and animated charts.

## Features  
- **AWS Cost Analytics**: Retrieve and visualize cost and usage data using Python and AWS Cost Explorer API.  
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Provision cloud resources using Terraform.  
- **Configuration Management**: Automate server configuration using Ansible.  
- **Containerization**: Dockerize applications for efficient deployment.  
- **Orchestration**: Use Kubernetes for managing containerized applications in clusters.  
- **Cost Optimization**: Best practices for minimizing cloud costs and monitoring resource utilization.

## Tools and Technologies  
1. **Python**: Data visualization (matplotlib, pandas), integration with AWS SDK.  
2. **Terraform**: Automate cloud resource provisioning.  
3. **Ansible**: Configuration management for Kubernetes and Dockerized applications.  
4. **Docker**: Create and manage containers for deployment.  
5. **Kubernetes**: Orchestrate containers in clusters.  
6. **AWS Services**: EC2, S3, RDS, Cost Explorer.  
7. **Matplotlib**: Animated and static visualizations of cloud costs.
